The GDELT Project is the largest, most comprehensive, and highest resolution open database of human society ever created. 
Just the 2015 data alone records nearly three quarters of a trillion emotional snapshots and more than 1.5 billion location references, 
while its total archives span more than 215 years, making it one of the largest open-access spatio-temporal datasets in existance and pushing the boundaries of "big data" study of global human society. Its Global Knowledge Graph connects the world's people, organizations, locations, themes, counts, images and emotions into a single holistic network over the entire planet. How can you query, explore, model, visualize, 
interact, and even forecast this vast archive of human society?
